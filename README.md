# Neurodevelopmental Severity Prediction Model  

## ðŸ”„ Model Update: Version 2

In this updated version of the **Neurodevelopmental Severity Prediction Model**, I have:
- Incorporated **Low Birth Weight Data** as a feature
- Integrated **Public Health Expenditure Data** for additional context
- Retrained the model using the new dataset

### Performance Improvement:
| Metric | Previous Model | Updated Model (v2) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | 3.7139 | **3.5911** âœ… |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | 42.0318 | **41.0843** âœ… |
| **RÂ² Score** | 0.6488 | **0.6567** âœ… |

The model now better predicts neurodevelopmental disorder severity in Sri Lankan children by integrating **biological and healthcare expenditure factors**. 

 **Latest model version:** `neurodevelopmental_severity_model_v2.pkl`

## ðŸ”„ Model : Version 1

Predicting Neurodevelopmental Severity in Sri Lankan Children Using Machine Learning
Neurodevelopmental disorders in early childhood can affect a child's cognitive, social, and motor skills, impacting their long-term development. I wanted to explore whether machine learning could help predict the severity of developmental difficulties in Sri Lankan children. The idea was to see if a data-driven approach could contribute to early detection and better intervention strategies.

For this project, I used data from the Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2016, specifically focusing on child development indicators. The dataset includes responses from mothers of children aged 2-5 years, covering aspects like speech clarity, vision, motor function, and cognitive abilities. Since this data reflects functional difficulties rather than clinical diagnoses, I designed the model to estimate relative risk rather than make definitive conclusions.

Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
The dataset had missing values and inconsistencies, so I cleaned it by:

Filling missing values using mean/mode imputation
Selecting key features related to developmental difficulties
Converting categorical variables into numerical format
Once processed, I split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, resulting in 40 training samples and 10 test samplesâ€”a small but useful starting point.

Step 2: Model Testing & Performance
I first ran a Linear Regression model as a baseline test. It showed some predictive power (MAE: 0.79, RÂ²: 0.64), but it was clear that a more advanced approach was needed.

I then tested Random Forest and XGBoost models:

Random Forest performed best (RÂ²: 0.32), while
XGBoost performed the worst (RÂ²: 0.09)
After optimizing the Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning, the final RÂ² score improved to 0.25, but there was still room for refinement.

Step 3: Feature Importance Analysis
To understand which factors contributed most to predictions, I ran a feature importance analysis. The top predictors were:

Feature	Importance Score
Childâ€™s speech clarity	21.5%
Vision difficulties	18.8%
Cognitive slowness indicators	17.2%
Presence of convulsions/fits	9.7%
Canâ€™t understand words	9.0%
Interestingly, hearing difficulties contributed very little, suggesting it may not be a strong predictor in this dataset.

Step 4: Expanding the Model
To improve accuracy, I incorporated public health expenditure data and child malnutrition indicators to see if broader socioeconomic factors influenced developmental difficulties. The updated model showed a slight improvement:

Model	MAE	MSE	RÂ² Score
Baseline Random Forest	3.79	45.33	0.62
With Public Health & Child Malnutrition Data	3.59	41.08	0.65 
Next Steps
This is still a work in progress, and I plan to:

Expand the dataset to include more socioeconomic indicators
Test alternative models, including ensemble learning
Refine feature selection to increase predictive accuracy
Validate the model against real-world clinical assessments
If improved, this model could be useful for public health agencies, policy discussions on early interventions, and neurodevelopmental research in Sri Lanka.

Iâ€™d love to hear any feedback so do reach out!
